                <p><span>SO IS THIS A REAL BAND?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>YES! TSKFRC IS A REAL BAND WITH REAL PEOPLE IN IT MAKING REAL MUSIC FOR OTHER REAL PEOPLE.<br>
                    HOWEVER INSTEAD OF THE BANDS CONTENT EXISTING IN CONVENTIONAL SPACES LIKE BASICALLY EVERY SINGLE BAND BEFORE THEM.<br>
                    THE ENTIRETY OF TSKFRC'S CREATIVE OUTPUT AND CONTENT ONLY EXISTS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN AND SUBSEQUENTLY CAN ONLY BE CONSUMED OVER THE BLOCKCHAIN.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>WHO IS TSKFRC COMMANDER 666?</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>NOT THEIR REAL NAME - BUT IT'S WHAT THEY CURRENTLY GO BY.<br><br>
                     TSKFRC COMMANDER 666 IS A MULTI INSTRUMENTALIST<br>
                     AND VISUAL ARTIST WHO HAS SPENT THE LAST 10+ YEARS RECORDING AND RELEASING MUSIC AND ART AS WELL AS TRAVELLING THE WORLD IN PUNK BANDS <br>
                     WHO HAVE PERFORMED ACROSS THE GLOBE EVERYWHERE FROM MAJOR OPEN AIR FESTIVALS TO SQUAT HOUSES TO RECORD STORES TO BARS, CLUBS, PUBS, CAR PARKS AND EVERYWHERE AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.<br><br>
                     THEIR WORK HAS BEEN RELEASED THROUGH RECORD LABELS , INDEPENDENLTY AND EVEN BEEN BOOTLEGGED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO SOLID SUCCESS<br><br>
                     NOW AFTER BEING INVOLVED IN THE CRYPTO AND NFT SPACE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS<br>
                     TSKFRC HAS BEEN CREATED AS THEIR NEXT MAJOR FOCUS. </span>
                </p>
                <p><span>HOW DO I HEAR THE BANDS MUSIC?</span></p>
                <p><span>ALL GENESIS NFT TOKENS WILL CONTAIN A MINI TRACK TO SYNC UP WITH THE VISUAL CONTAINED ON THEIR NFT. </span></p>
                <p><span>THE DIFFERENT TRAITS OF THE NFT COME IN THE FORM OF DIFFERENT AUDIO TRAITS. </span></p>
                <p><span>THIS IS THE FIRST PIECE OF TSKFRC MUSIC TO BE RELEASED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. IT IS RAW, UNCOMPROMISED, INITIAL AUDIO DESIGNED TO SOUND LIKE ITS COME UNFILTERED FRESH OUT OF A REHEARSAL ROOM OR GARAGE AND IS A TASTE OF THINGS TO COME.</span></p>
                <p><span>THE BANDS FIRST FULL LENGTH SINGLE WILL BE RELEASED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE INITIAL GENESIS TOKEN DROP. THE FIRST SINGLE WILL BE AN AIRDROP TO WHICH ALL HOLDERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO - DETAILS ON THAT TO BE REVEALED AFTER RELEASE. </span></p>
                <p><span>UNTIL THEN THERE IS A SNEAK PEAK TRACK AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE WE ARE USING FOR MARKETING PURPOSES</span></p>
                <p><span>WHAT’S THIS I HEAR ABOUT THE BAND RECORDING IN OUTER SPACE?</span></p>
                <p><span>AS MENTIONED - THE GENESIS NFT TOKEN CONTAINS BOTH VISUAL AND AUDIO. </span>
                    <br><br><span>EACH TOKEN IS VISUALLY INDIVIDUAL. NO TWO TOKENS LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.</span>
                    <br><br><span>THE DIFFERENT AUDIO TRAITS IS WHAT PROVIDES THE RARITY OF THE TOKENS.</span>
                    <br><br><span>AND YES - SOME OF THESE PIECES OF AUDIO HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN OUTER SPACE. </span>
                    <br><br><span>USING ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION WAVES COLLECTED BY NASA FROM VARIOUS CORNERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM TSKFRC COMMANDER 666 HAS TRANSPOSED SAID DATA COLLECTED BY NASA INTO LISTENABLE AUDIO AND BLENDED INTO A TRACK TO COMBINE WITH YOUR NFT!</span>
                    <br><br><span>EVER WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE SOUNDS OF RADIATION COMING OFF OF THE RINGS OF SATURN WOULD SOUND LIKE OR WHAT THE LIGHTNING STORMS OF JUPITER COMBINED WITH DRUMS AND GUITARS WOULD SOUND LIKE? </span>
                    <br><br><span>GRAB AN NFT AND HAVE A LISTEN. </span></p>
                <p><span>IS THIS THE FIRST PUNK BAND TO FULLY EXIST ON THE BLOCKCHAIN?</span></p>
                <p><span>YES. THIS IS THE VERY FIRST PUNK BAND TO FULLY EXIST PURELY ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.</span></p>
                <p><span>IS THIS A MUSIC OR VISUAL ART PROJECT?</span></p>
                <p><span>BOTH. POST OUR GENESIS TOKEN RELEASE - THE GROWTH OF THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE CONTINUOUS RELEASES OF DIGITAL ART COMBINED WITH MUSIC WITH EACH RELEASE TO BE INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED TO SUIT THE PROJECTS SUCCESS FOR ALL HOLDERS. </span></p>
                <p><span>IS THIS AN AVATAR OR PFP PROJECT?</span></p>
                <p><span>KIND OF BUT NOT REALLY. </span>
                    <br><br><span>THIS PROJECT IS FAR DIFFERENT TO ANY OTHER PFP OR AVATAR PROJECT CURRENTLY ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. </span>
                    <br><br><span>INSTEAD OF VISUAL TRAITS LIKE MOST AVATAR PROJECTS HAVE - THIS PROJECT USES AUDIO AS THE DEFINING RARITY TRAIT. IT ALSO CONTAINS UTILITY INSTEAD OF BEING JUST PURELY A COLLECTIBLE. </span>
                    <br><br><span>WE STILL ENCOURAGE ALL HOLDERS TO USE AS THEIR PFP OR AVATAR SHOULD THEY WISH.</span></p>
                <p><span>OK. SOUNDS COOL. HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?</span></p>
                <p><span>PURCHASE A GENESIS UTILITY NFT TOKEN THROUGH OUR MINTING ENGINE ON THIS WEBSITE WITH SOME ETHEREUM - OR IF SOLD OUT - PURCHASE THROUGH THE SECONDARY MARKET ON OPENSEA - AND YOU WILL HAVE ATTAINED ALL YOU NEED FOR ENTRY TO THE GANG.</span></p>
                <p><span>WHAT IS A GENESIS UTILITY TOKEN?</span></p>
                <p><span>A GENESIS UTILITY TOKEN IS A TOKEN THAT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A PROJECT. </span>
                    <br><br><span>THE UTILITY COMES FROM THE IDEA THAT HOLDING THIS TOKEN PROVIDES YOU AN ACTUAL USE CASE - WHICH IS YOUR KEY TO JOINING THE TSKFRC GANG AND BEING READILY AVAILABLE TO RECEIVE ALL THE PERKS THAT COME WITH THAT.</span></p>
                <p><span>HOW DO I PURCHASE THIS GENESIS TOKEN?</span></p>
                <p><span>CONNECT YOUR METAMASK WALLET TO THE DAPP ATTACHED TO THIS WEBSITE.</span>
                    <br><br><span>IF YOU DON’T HAVE METAMASK DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED TO YOUR BROWSER WITH YOUR ETHEREUM WALLET SET UP WITHIN METAMASK YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS. ENSURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH ETHEREUM IN YOUR WALLET TO MAKE THE PURCHASE</span>
                    <br><br><span>ONCE CONNECTED HIT THE MINT BUTTON ON OUR MINTING ENGINE AND A GENESIS TOKEN WILL BE MINTED AT RANDOM AND STORE ITSELF IN YOUR ETHEREUM WALLET.  </span>
                    <br><br><span>YOU CAN ALSO VIEW YOUR TOKEN ON OPENSEA</span></p>
                <p><span>HOW MUCH IS A GENESIS TOKEN?</span></p>
                <p><span>ALL GENESIS TOKENS WILL GO ON SALE AT THE MINT PRICE OF 0.08 ETH. THERE IS NO BONDING CURVE. WE BELIEVE EVERYONE DESERVES THE RIGHT TO INITIALLY PURCHASE AT THE SAME PRICE.</span></p>
                <p><span>WHERE DO I STORE MY TOKENS AND CONTENT?</span></p>
                <p><span>IN ANY SUPPORTING ETHEREUM WALLET</span></p>
                <p><span>WHAT IS THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF TOKENS?</span></p>
                <p><span>ONLY 6666 GENESIS UTILITY NFT TOKENS WILL EVER EXIST.</span></p>
                <p><span>DO THE TOKENS RANGE IN RARITY?</span></p>
                <p><span>YES. AS WELL AS PROVIDING UTILITY THE TOKENS ALSO RANGE IN RARITY. </span>
                    <br><br><span>THE TOKEN TRAITS DIFFER IN BOTH AUDIO AND VISUAL CONTENT - EXACT TRAIT RARITY AND FIGURES WILL BE REVEALED POST MINT.</span></p>
                <p><span>SO... WHATS IN IT FOR ME?</span></p>
                <p><span>BY OWNING AND HOLDING THE TSKFRC GENESIS UTILITY TOKEN YOU NOT ONLY GET TO OWN THE INITIAL DROP FROM THE FIRST PUNK BAND TO EVER EXIST ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.</span>
                    <br><br><span>BUT YOU GAIN THE ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL UPCOMING TSKFRC NFT DROPS THAT THE PUBLIC AREN’T ABLE TO ACCESS WITHOUT THE TOKEN. </span>
                    <br><br><span>ALL COMMUNICATION ABOUT THESE RELEASES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE TSKFRC DISCORD SERVER WHICH YOU WILL ALSO GAIN ACCESS TO.</span>
                    <br><br><span>HOLDERS ALSO GAIN ACCESS TO ALL MEMBER ONLY EXCLUSIVITIES - TO WHICH THERE ARE MANY INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO OWN RARE COLLABORATIVE NFT'S WITH THE BEST DIGITAL ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS ACROSS THE METAVERSE, ORIGINAL TSKFRC MATERIAL AND MORE.</span>
                    <br><br><span>THE LIMITED SUPPLY OF THESE GENESIS TOKENS MEANS THERE WILL ONLY EVER BE 6666 TOKENS EVER MADE AVAILABLE.</span>
                    <br><br><span>WE PREDICT THESE TOKENS WILL INCREASE IN VALUE OVER TIME AS THE PROJECT GROWS AND THE ADDED VALUE AND UTILITY ATTACHED TO THE TOKEN BECOMES FAR MORE PREVALENT.</span></p>
                <p><span>WILL THERE BE AIRDROPS?</span></p>
                <p><span>YES</span>
                    <br><br><span>WE CAN CONFIRM THE INITIAL SINGLE WILL BE AN AIRDROP RELEASE TO ALL HOLDERS IN VARIOUS FORMS AND FORMATS. MOVING FORWARD AIRDROPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ISSUED TO HOLDERS - WITH EXACT FIGURES AND DATES TO BE REVEALED AT A LATER DATE.</span></p>
                <p><span> CAN I SELL MY TSKFRC GENESIS TOKEN AFTER I PURCHASE IT?</span></p>
                <p><span> YES. YOU CAN SELL YOUR TSKFRC GENESIS TOKEN ON OPENSEA ON THE SECONDARY MARKET. HOWEVER WITHOUT HOLDING THE TOKEN YOU NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE TSKFRC GANG AND THE PERKS THAT COME WITH THAT - THEY WILL ALL BE PASSED ON TO WHOEVER PURCHASES YOUR TOKEN FROM YOU.</span></p>
                <p><span>HOW DO I PARTICIPATE IN THE TSKFRC GANG AND SPEAK TO OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY?</span></p>
                <p><span>ON TOP OF TWTTER AN INTERACTIVE TSKFRC GANG DISCORD WILL BE SET UP FOR ALL GANG MEMBERS TO SPEAK WITH ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS DIRECTLY WITH THE BAND TO GET THE LATEST ON UPCOMING RELEASES, AIRDROPS AND OTHER EXCITING NEWS.</span></p>
                <p><span>TELL ME MORE ABOUT COLLABORATIONS AND FUTURE MEMBER ONLY DROPS?</span></p>
                <p><span>AS THE PROJECT GROWS SO WILL THE CONTENT AVAILABLE TO GANG MEMBERS.</span>
                    <br><br><span>THIS INCLUDES LIMITED NFT RELEASES WITH ORIGINAL MUSIC AND ART RAGING IN EDITION SIZES.</span>
                    <br><br><span>AS WELL AS COLLABORATIVE NFT’S WITH AMAZING DIGITAL ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS ACROSS THE ENTIRE METAVERSE.</span></p>
                <p><span>WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU COLLABORATING WITH?</span></p>
                <p><span>THAT’S CURRENTLY TOP SECRET. BUT 10+ YEARS IN THE MUSIC AND ART SCENE AND 2+ YEARS IN THE CRYPTO AND NFT SCENE MEANS I HAVE SOME PRETTY SPECIAL PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD IN LINE TO BRING MEMBERS OF THE TSKFRC GANG SOME VERY EXCITING PIECES.</span></p>
                <p><span>DO I OWN THE COMMERCIAL RIGHTS TO THE MUSIC AND ART?</span></p>
                <p><span>YES.</span>
                    <br><br><span>MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS TO BE RELEASED ON THIS IN THE FUTURE, BUT CERTAIN  FUTURE TSKFRC NFT’S WILL GRANT OWNERS FULL COMMERCIAL RIGHTS TO DO WITH AS THEY PLEASE.</span>
                    <br><br><span>PRESS YOUR OWN VINYL , START YOUR OWN RECORD LABEL, CREATE YOUR OWN MERCH - IF YOU OWN THE NFT - ITS YOURS TO DO WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT - AND WE URGE ALL OWNERS TO GET CREATIVE WITH THEIR PIECES.</span></p>
                <p><span>WHY SOCK PUPPETS?</span></p>
                <p><span>APART FROM JUST BEING AWESOME.</span>
                    <br><br><span>A SOCK PUPPET REPRESENTS SOMEONE WHO IS KNOWN FOR ANONYMOUSLY DISRUPTING POLITICS, BUSINESS AND OTHER FORMS OF INSTITUTIONAL BUREAUCRACY ONLINE - EXACTLY WHAT THE TSKFRC GANG IS ATTEMPTING TO DO TO THE TRADITIONAL MUSIC INDUSTRY - TOGETHER - NOT AS A COMMUNITY - BUT AS A GANG.</span></p>
                <p><span>WILL THERE BE PHYSICAL RELEASES AND MERCH?</span></p>
                <p><span>YES. </span>
                    <br><br><span>HOLDER ONLY MERCH WILL BE AVAILABLE. MANY OF WHICH WILL BE FOR FREE FOR ALL HOLDERS.</span>
                    <br><br><span>ONTOP OF MERCHANDISE - WE CAN CONFIRM THAT PHYSICAL RELEASES ON BOTH VINYL AND CASSETTE FEATURING TSKFRC MATERIAL, COLLABORATIVE DIGITAL ART AND MORE WILL BE RELEASED AT A LATER DATE AND BE AVAILABLE TO HOLDERS AND PURCHASERS. </span>
                    <br><br><span>BUT MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. </span></p>
                <p><span>tell me more about the tskfrc record label you have hinted at?</span></p>
                <p><span> dont want to give too much away, but expect more bands more artists and more utility out of simply holding your token </span></p>
                <p><span> WHAT’S THE COOLER PIT MOVE - STAGE DIVING OR CIRCLE PITTING?</span></p>
                <p><span>STAGE DIVING. HARD AND FAST. ALWAYS. </span>
                    <br><br><span>I can
               </span></p>
